# AlgoWiz-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Visualizers
AlgoWiz is a Multi-Platform Application that allows users to Visualize various Data Structures and Algorithms. Data Structures included: Including Linked List, Stack, Queues, Tree, Graphs, etc. Algorithms includes: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Pre, Post, In, and Level-order Traversal(for Trees), Djikstra Shortest Path Algorithm, Prim's and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning tree Algorithm, etc.


## 1. Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 2. Prerequisites

The Project is already packed and encrytped to include all the dependencies/prerequisites for the ease of setup and usage. After extracting the file, users will find the following items:<br>
* **AlgoWiz:** The main application file to deploy/run the program. Open the file to run the application<br>
* **images:** Contains the images used in the application<br>
* **source:** Contains the source python code for the application<br>
* **_pycache_:** Includes bytecode header files and library dependencies for the program<br>

### Deployment
The first screen of AlgoWiz comprises of two options: Tree Algorithms and Graph Algorithms.

### 3. Tree Algorithms
Here you can generate complete binary trees and perform various algorithms on it. Users should follow the following steps to visualize: 
1. Number of nodes/vertices in the Tree
2. Number to search in the tree
3. Click on the "Create" Button to Generate the graph
4. Select from the list of Algorithms to perform on the Tree to visualize. <br>

These includes:
  - In-order Traversal
  - Pre-order Traversal
  - Post-order Traversal
  - Breadth First Search
  - Depth First Search
  - Level Order Search

##### Note: If there is no number entered in the search field, AlgoWiz would traverse the entire tree.

### 4. Custom Data Structures and Algorithms
With Algowiz, you can also create Custom Data Structures. 
#### 4.1. Generating Custom Data Structures
Users can create their own custom Data Structure by providing the following input in the Text Area:
 **Graph with one Node/Vertex 'vertex1' , with weight 'weight1':** <br>
>                           {vertex 1: {'weight': weight 1}}

 **Graph with Multiple Nodes/Vertices 'vertex 1', vertex 2',...'vertex n', with weights 'weight 1', 'weight 2',..., 'weight n':** <br>
>                 {vertex1: {vertex2: {'weight' : weight1}}, {vertex3: {'weight' : weight2}}}

With this notation, users can find various data structures. These include:

* **Singly-Linked List** <br> <br>

* **Doubly-Linked List** <br> <br>
![](https://github.com/Akbonline/AlgoWiz-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Visualizers/blob/master/images/doublylinkedlist.jpg)
* **Stacks** <br> <br>
![](https://github.com/Akbonline/AlgoWiz-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Visualizers/blob/master/images/Stack.JPG)
* **Queues** <br> <br>
![](https://github.com/Akbonline/AlgoWiz-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Visualizers/blob/master/images/Queue.JPG)
* **Trees** <br> <br>
![](https://github.com/Akbonline/AlgoWiz-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Visualizers/blob/master/images/Tree.JPG)
* **Graphs** <br> <br>
![](https://github.com/Akbonline/AlgoWiz-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Visualizers/blob/master/images/Graph.JPG)

#### 4.2. Visualing Random Graphs: <br>
Users can also create random Graphs by giving and perform various algorithms on it. Users should follow the following steps to visualize: 
1. Number of nodes/vertices in the Graph
2. Number to search in the Graph
3. Click on the "Create" Button to Generate the graph
4. Select from the list of Algorithms to perform on the Graph to visualize. <br>

These includes:
  - Breadth First Search
  - Depth First Search
  - Level Order Search
  - Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree
  - Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree
  - Djikstra's Shortest Path Finding between Start and End Node
  
##### Note: If there is no number entered in the search field, AlgoWiz would traverse the entire Data Structure.

## TODO:
* Improve the Latency: Packaging through pyinstaller is kinda sucky...
* Make a better OOP model
* Fix Switching Issues
* Adding more algorithms to it: Binary & Linear Search/ Sorting Algorithms
