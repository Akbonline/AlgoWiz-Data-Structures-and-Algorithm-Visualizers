# AlgoWiz-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Visualizers
AlgoWiz is a Multi-Platform Application that allows users to Visualize various Data Structures and Algorithms. Data Structures included: Including Linked List, Stack, Queues, Tree, Graphs, etc. Algorithms includes: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Pre, Post, In, and Level-order Traversal(for Trees), Djikstra Shortest Path Algorithm, Prim's and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning tree Algorithm, etc.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The Project is already packed and encrytped to include all the dependencies/prerequisites for the ease of setup and usage. After extracting the file, users will find the following items:
##### > AlgoWiz:
The main application file to deploy/run the program. Open the file to run the application
##### > images: 
Contains the images used in the application
##### > source:
Contains the source python code for the application
##### > _pycache_:
Includes bytecode header files and library dependencies for the program
### Deployment

The first screen of AlgoWiz comprises of two options: Tree Algorithms and Graph Algorithms.

Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
